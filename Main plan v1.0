I'm gonna have a home server that for now will be a raspberry pi 2B 1.2 and i will later "upgrade" to a dell 3100 chromebook with ubuntu as OS
The server will control:
count:  object:   
3x      par 56 
8x-10x  spots
x       media for a beamer
there may be more things in the future

for the par 56:
a wall dimmer will be used as a potmeter and is going to be conected to a arduino
the arduino will use the potmeter and send a midi signal to the server
the server will via qlc+ convert the midi signals to DMX.512 signals

for the spots:
the spots will be hombli smart spot RGB and CCT
for the time being it wil just be on and off

a wall switch is going to be the input for a ESP8266
te ESP8266 will through a webhook connect with IFTTT and activate 1 off 2 actions:
action 1:
if switch is on the rgb bulbs will be turned on
if switch is off the rgb bulbs will be turned off
its quite simple

The media server is something I will have to think about so that will come later


the things i am going to use for control:
1x server (raspberry pi and/or chromebook)
1x ESP8266
1x Arduino
1x USB-DMX converter
