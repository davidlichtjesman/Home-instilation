I'm gonna have a home server that for now will be a raspberry pi 2B 1.2 and i will later "upgrade" to a dell 3100 chromebook with ubuntu as OS
The server will control:
count:  object:   
3x      par 56 
8x-10x  spots
x       media for a beamer
4x      speakers
there may be more things in the future

for the par 56:
a wall dimmer will be used as a potmeter and is going to be conected to a arduino
the arduino will use the potmeter and send a midi signal to the server
the server will via qlc+ convert the midi signals to DMX.512 signals

for the spots:
the spots will be hombli smart spot RGB and CCT
for the time being it wil just be on and off

a wall switch is going to be the input for a ESP8266
te ESP8266 will through a webhook connect with IFTTT and activate 1 off 2 actions:
action 1:
if switch is on the rgb bulbs will be turned on
if switch is off the rgb bulbs will be turned off
its quite simple

The media server is something I will have to think about so that will come later

server with monitor:
i am going to make a gui in visual studio code (the language will probaly be python)
the control will be close to my bed
main layout sketch
bottom middle: control for music/video
bottom right: toggle for gui dark/out mode (a little button wil always be visible to i can turn it on)
upper left: control for pars: r, g, b, dimmer, possible chasers? (colours dimmers?) (MIDI)
upper left right: control spots on off toggle switch (MIDI)
upper right: time and date display

server without monitor:
going to run qlc+ and next to it is going to sit the esp8266 custom open case



the things i am going to use for control:
1x server (raspberry pi and/or chromebook)
1x ESP8266
1x Arduino
1x USB-DMX converter

NEW IDEAS:
use the chromebook as a monitor for the server through Spacedesk
benefits: touchscreen for the server control
down side: need power for both chromebook and server
